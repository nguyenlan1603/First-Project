<h2>EVERY DAY IS A JOURNEY</h2>

  <p class="colum2">Leaving to travel around the world was simply the best decision of our lives! Since that one day in 2012 when we decided around a bottle of wine to travel around the world, our lives have been completely disrupted.</p>
  <p class="colum3">We travelled full-time for 19 months from China to South America via Southeast Asia, we made dozens of encounters, discovered places that will remain engraved in our memories, got to know other cultures, other languages...
    We first traveled at full speed, then slowed down to just take the time... the time to talk, to meet, the time that we often lack in our daily lives. </p>

  <h3>GROUP TOURS</h3>
  <p class="descretail">Then came the period “slow travel” or “praise of slowness” to learn how to travel at a slower pace… After reading all this, I remember perfectly thinking to myself:</p>

  <h3>BUS TRAVEL</h3>
  <p class="descretail">We usually read backpackers’ experiences who say they started their journey euphorically in “I visit new things every day” mode, then slowed down until they no longer marvelled at incredible things (while being aware of that)…</p>

  <p class="descretail">I had read a lot of articles before leaving about the tiredness that sets in during a long trip, or in other words, “the traveller’s blues”.</p>

    <p class="delight">Well, it was a little predictable, though! We had waited so long for this moment, we had dreamed of it so much. We were finally on our ” round the world tour “. It would just be strange not to be euphoric . So we listened to oureselves and visited China with this incredible energy we had at the beginning of the trip! 10 weeks in China and so many first experiences for us: First trip in a crowded metro with our backpacks, first couchsurfing, first night bus, first meal unidentified in the plate, first stomach issues… beautiful encounters, a beautiful proposal on the great wall of China</p>
